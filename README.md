# Nonlinear-Optical-Characterization-of-Zn-Doped-L-Glycine-Barium-Chloride-Single-Crystals
Research project on the synthesis and nonlinear optical characterization of Zn¬≤‚Å∫ doped L-Glycine Barium Chloride single crystals, including synthesis methods, structural analysis, and SHG testing.

## üìö Project Summary

In this study, single crystals of L-Glycine Barium Chloride were grown using the slow evaporation solution growth technique and doped with Zn¬≤‚Å∫ ions to enhance their nonlinear optical properties. The doped crystals were characterized using:

- ‚úÖ Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction (SCXRD)
- ‚úÖ Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD)
- ‚úÖ UV-Visible-NIR Spectroscopy
- ‚úÖ Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS)
- ‚úÖ Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) Analysis

The doping with Zn¬≤‚Å∫ ions improved the structural quality and SHG efficiency, making the material a strong candidate for photonic and optoelectronic applications.
